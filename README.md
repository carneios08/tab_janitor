# tab_janitor

A Google Chrome extension that removes tab clutter. Opening a tab that is similar to other active tab(s) will collapse the similar tab(s) leaving only the new one. The definition of similar is based on the options the user sets for the extension; these options are as follows:
  - Base URL: This will compare the URLs for similarity up until the URL arguments list starts (the '?' character).
  - Entire URL: This will compare the URLs based on their entirety; if it's not an exact match, it won't collapse the other tabs.

*NOTE: This extension is a work in-progress and should not be pulled at this time. *
