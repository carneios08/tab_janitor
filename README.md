# Tab Janitor

A Google Chrome extension that removes tab clutter by collapsing duplicate tabs each time a navigation is performed.

After downloading the extension from either Github or the Google Web Store, go into the extension's _Options_. There, you will see two "Modes" to choose from: "Base URL" and "Entire URL". If you choose "Base URL" (this is the default mode chosen if you opt to not configure the extension), the extension will only remove tabs that match the URL up until the '?' character (the URL's arguments list). If you choose "Entire URL", the extension will only remove tabs that match the URL in its entirety (arguments list included).

Once you are satisfied with your "Mode", you can click the "Submit" button to save your changes. Alternatively, you can click the "Reset" button to clear any changes you have made and revert the form back to the data that is currently saved.

No user input or interference is required for the extension to work; it automatically executes whenever you navigate to a new page.
